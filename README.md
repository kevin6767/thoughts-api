Created a working API using Express, Moment, and Mongoose. 

This project is intended to showcase my ability to be able to create a backend API that would useable to the front end. During this project I learned many valuable tools to help me continue to grow as a developer. 

Here is a video demo that showcases some of the features associated with the API using Insomnia.
